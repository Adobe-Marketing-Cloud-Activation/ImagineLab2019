## What Assets are in this Repo
Here you will find assets like digital copies of the lab manual and presentations.  We may have some printed copies for those attending in person but we prefer attendees use a digital copy where possible.
You will also find any scripts or code snippets that need to be used in the Lab.  That is just to make it easier to copy and paste, rather than to re-type everything.
